                      ESP Encrypted Echo Protocol
               draft-antony-ipsecme-encrypted-esp-ping-00

Abstract

   This document defines an Encrypted ESP Echo Function, a novel
   mechanism designed to assess the reachability of an IP Security
   (IPsec) network path using Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   packets.  The primary objective of this function is to facilitate the
   detection of end-to-end path status dynamically in a reliable and
   efficient manner, only using encrypted ESP packets between the IPsec
   peers.  The echo message can use existing congestion control payloads
   from [RFC9347]and also specifies additional payloads, specifically
   for bi-directional probing and requesting a return path.

1.  Introduction

   In response to the operational need for a robust data-plane failure-
   detection mechanism for IP Security (IPsec) Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP), this document introduces ESP Ping; Echo reqest and
   response.  This protocol offers a solution for assessing network path
   reachability and can optionally specify a return path for echo reply
   messages.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in IKEv2 [RFC4301]:
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), Security Association (SA),
   Security Policy Database (SPD).

   This document uses the following terms defined in IKEv2 [RFC9347]:
   constant rate on the AGGFRAG tunnel.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Problem Statement

   Diagnosing operational problems in IPsec can be challenging.  The
   proposed ESP encrypted echo function aims to address these challenges
   and provide a reliable diagnostic tool.

3.1.  ESP Blocked or Filtered

   An IPsec session typically employs ESP in tunnel or transport mode,
   using IP or IPv6 packets with a Next Header value of 50.  ESP
   parameters are negotiated using IKEv2, with default IKEv2 messages
   exchanged over UDP port 500.  In scenarios where ESP packets are not
   encapsulated in UDP, successful IKE negotiation may occur, but ESP
   packets might fail to reach the peer due to differences in the packet
   path or filtering policies compared to IKE packets.  Additionally,
   when not using UDP encapsulation, ESP packets may encounter different
   filtering policies.  Although this is less likely, it is still
   possible and can be hard to diagnose.  Operational experience
   suggests that networks and some home routers that drop ESP packets
   are common enough to be a problem for general-purpose VPN
   applications desiring to work reliably on the Internet.

3.2.  Probing Multiple Paths

   When there are multiple paths created using multiple Child SAs with
   identical Traffic Selectors as specified in [RFC7296]or more
   explicitly in [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-multi-sa-performance], there is a
   need to probe each Child SA, including the network path,
   independently from an IPsec peer.  Each SA may traverse different
   network paths and may have different policies.  The ESP Encrypted
   Ping would specifically help determine the reachability of each path
   independently.

3.3.  Probe Return Path

   IPsec Security Associations (SAs) are negotiated as a pair,
   consisting of two unidirectional SAs in one exchange.  IKEv2
   [RFC7296]Section 2.9 allows installing multiple Child SAs with
   identical Traffic Selectors.  When there are multiple paths, the ESP
   Echo should support requesting an echo response via a specific return
   path SA.  To allow requesting a return path, additional attributes
   are necessary.  The sender can propose a list of specific SPI for
   return paths in the preferred order.  The SPIs in the proposed list
   must be present on the local system with the same endpoint as the
   destination.  This is also necessary when the sender would like to
   probe a path when there are multiple possible paths present.  For
   example, if there is a path over a satellite link and over fiber, the
   receiving peer may have a policy to respond via the fiber path even
   when the request arrives via the satellite link.  If the sender
   requests a return path, the receiver SHOULD try to respond via that
   path, SA.  However, the final decision is up to the receiver.  If the
   receiver still decides to send the response via a different path, it
   SHOULD clearly indicate the chosen path in the response.

3.4.  Manually Probing a Constant Rate on the AGGFRAG Tunnel

   In IPsec setups, maintaining a constant traffic rate can help in
   disguising actual traffic patterns, providing enhanced security.  The
   AGGFRAG tunnel enables constant rate probing to ensure consistent
   bandwidth usage, helping to mitigate the risk of traffic analysis by
   adversaries.  This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where
   maintaining a uniform traffic pattern is critical for security.

3.5.  Why Not Use Existing IP Tools?

   Existing tools such as ICMP ping or traceroute assume IP
   connectivity.  However, in IPsec gateway setups, the gateway itself
   may not have an IP address that matches the IPsec Security Policy
   Database (SPD).  Due to this, ESP messages must be used without
   relying on the SPD.

   Additionally, in the case of multiple SAs as mentioned above, IP
   tools would find it hard, if not impossible, to generate IP traffic
   to explore multiple paths specifically.

3.6.  Also Track Incoming Traffic

   In addition to probing the outgoing paths, it is essential to monitor
   and account for the incoming traffic to ensure comprehensive network
   visibility.  Incoming SA traffic counters are unique to IPsec
   compared to other tunneling or native IP connections.  In IPsec, the
   incoming counters reliably indicate a viable path.  This should be
   taken into account when probing IPsec paths.

4.  Protocol Specification

   After completing an IPsec SA negotiation, [RFC7296], an IPsec peer
   wishing to verify the viability of the current network path for ESP
   packets MAY initiate an ESP Echo Request.  The ESP Echo Request
   packet must be encrypted.  If the SPIs are negotiated it SHOULD
   utilize an SPI value previously negotiated, e.g.  negotiated through
   IKEv2.

   The sender sets the ESP Next Header value to AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD which
   has the value 144, as specified in [RFC9347].  This can be followed
   by different echo request sub-type payloads with well defined format
   and empty data blocks following it.

   The receiving IPsec peer, having established ESP through IKE, MAY
   respond to an ESP Echo Response.  When replying to an encrypted ESP
   Echo Request, the ESP Echo Response MUST be encrypted and utilize the
   corresponding SPI.  The receiver also sets the ESP Next Header value
   to AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD: 144, followed by the requested sub-type which can
   be:

   *  IP-TFS Congestion Control AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Payload Format as
      specfied in [RFC9347]Section 6.1.2

   *  Additional payloads to request specific return paths as a list.
      MPLS has some examples of this

   *  Optional padding blocks. e.g if the IP-TFS poilcy is to use fixed
      length packet pading would be ncessary.

   These playloads are not subject to IPsec Security Policy(SP),
   typically negotiated using IKEv2 a nd manually configured.  End
   padding padding would be necessary of the the tunnel is always
   sending fixed size ESP pa yload or possibly detect path anamoolies.

   When probing do not take the lack of a response alone as an
   indication of the unreachability of the return path when probing
   using ESP echo; also consider the received bytes on the return path.
   IPsec has a unique advantage over other tunneling protocols when the

   return path shows incoming bytes, indicating that the path is
   partially functional.  This is especially useful when used as a
   liveness check on busy paths.  When there is no response, instead of
   concluding that the path is not viable and taking action, such as
   tearing down the IPsec connection, read the incoming bytes.  This
   would help avoid tearing down busy paths due to the lack of an ESP
   echo response.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are similar to other unconnected request-
   reply protocols such as ICMP or ICMPv6 echo.  The proposed ESP echo
   and response does not constitute an amplification attack because the
   ESP Echo Reply is atmost same size as the ESP Echo Request.  Further
   this can be rate limited or fitlered using ingress filtering per BCP
   38 [RFC2827]

6.  IANA Considerations

   Updates [RFC9347]to be allowed in in ESP without

7.  Operational Considerations

   When an explicit return path is requested and the responder's local
   policies do not allow that how do we deal with it?

   A typlical implementation would be a ESP Echo socket.  And the socket
   would allow to set outgoing SPI at creation, optionally matching
   source and destination address.  Once this set before sending any
   data.  Userspcace can only write payload into AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD
