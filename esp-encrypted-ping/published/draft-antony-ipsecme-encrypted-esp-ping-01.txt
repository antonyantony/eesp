               draft-antony-ipsecme-encrypted-esp-ping-01

Abstract

   This document defines an Encrypted ESP Echo Function, a novel
   mechanism designed to assess the reachability of an IP Security
   (IPsec) network path using Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
   packets.  The primary objective of this function is to facilitate the
   detection of end-to-end path status dynamically in a reliable and
   efficient manner, only using encrypted ESP packets between the IPsec
   peers.  The Encrypted Echo message can use existing congestion
   control payloads from RFC9347 or the message format specified here,
   with an optional preferred return path

1.  Introduction

   In response to the operational need for a robust data-plane failure-
   detection mechanism for IP Security (IPsec) Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP), this document introduces Encrypted ESP Ping; Echo
   request and response.  This protocol offers a solution for assessing
   network path reachability and can optionally specify a return path
   for echo reply messages.

   This document covers only Encrypted ESP Ping, while
   [I-D.colitti-ipsecme-esp-ping] specifies an unauthenticated ESP Ping.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in IKEv2 [RFC4301]:
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), Security Association (SA),
   Security Policy Database (SPD).

   This document uses the following terms defined in IKEv2 [RFC9347]:
   constant rate on the AGGFRAG tunnel.

   Path Specified LSP Ping

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use cases

   Diagnosing operational problems in IPsec can be challenging.  The
   proposed Encrypted ESP echo function aims to address these challenges
   and provide a reliable diagnostic tool.

3.1.  ESP Blocked or Filtered

   An IPsec session typically employs ESP, using IP or IPv6 packets.
   ESP parameters are negotiated using IKEv2, with default IKEv2
   messages exchanged over UDP port 500.  In scenarios where ESP packets
   are not encapsulated in UDP, i.e using protocol ESP, successful IKE
   negotiation may occur, but ESP packets might fail to reach the peer
   due to differences in the packet path or filtering policies compared
   to IKE packets (e.g., UDP is allowed while ESP is filtered, typically
   a misconfiguration).  Additionally, when using UDP encapsulation, ESP
   packets may encounter different filtering policies.  This is
   typically due to broken packet filtering.  Although this is less
   likely, it is still possible and can be hard to diagnose.
   Operational experience suggests that networks and some home routers
   that drop ESP packets are common enough to be a problem for general-
   purpose VPN applications desiring to work reliably on the Internet.
   Encrypted ESP Ping would be a great help to diagnose these scenarios.

3.2.  Probing Multiple Paths

   When there are multiple paths created using multiple Child SAs with
   identical Traffic Selectors as specified in [RFC7296]or more
   explicitly in [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-multi-sa-performance], there is a
   need to probe each Child SA, including the network path,
   independently from an IPsec peer.  Each SA may traverse different
   network paths and may have different policies.  The ESP Encrypted
   Ping would specifically help determine the reachability of each path
   independently.

3.3.  Probe Return Path

   IPsec Security Associations (SAs) are negotiated as a pair,
   consisting of two unidirectional SAs in one exchange.  IKEv2
   [RFC7296] Section 2.9 allows installing multiple Child SAs with
   identical Traffic Selectors.  When there are multiple paths, the
   Encrypte ESP Ping should support requesting an echo response via a
   specific return path IPsec SA.  To request a return path, additional
   attributes are necessary.  The sender proposes a specific SPI as the
   preferred return path.  The proposed return path SPI MUST be present
   on the local system with the same endpoint as the destination.  A
   specific return path is necessary when the sender would like to probe
   a path, and there are multiple possible paths present.  For example,
   if there is a path over a satellite link and over fiber, the
   receiving peer may have a policy to respond via the fiber path even
   when the request arrives via the satellite link.  If the sender
   requests a return path, the receiver SHOULD try to respond via that
   path, IPsec SA.  However, the final decision is up to the receiver.
   If the receiver decides to send the response via a different path
   than the requested return path, the sender would notice the chosen
   path in the response.  An example is Return Path Specified LSP ping
   specified in [RFC7110].

3.4.  Manually Probing a Constant Rate on the AGGFRAG Tunnel

   In IPsec setups, maintaining a constant traffic rate can help in
   disguising actual traffic patterns, providing enhanced security.  The
   AGGFRAG tunnel enables constant rate probing to ensure consistent
   bandwidth usage, helping to mitigate the risk of traffic analysis by
   adversaries.  This approach is particularly useful to discover
   possible bandwidth where maintaining a uniform traffic pattern is
   critical for security, using IP-TFS.

3.5.  Why Not Use Existing IP Tools

   Existing tools such as ICMP ping or traceroute assume IP
   connectivity.  However, in IPsec gateway setups, the gateway itself
   may not have an IP address that matches the IPsec Security Policy
   Database (SPD).  Due to this, ESP messages must be used without
   relying on the SPD.

   Additionally, in the case of multiple SAs as mentioned above, IP
   tools would find it hard, if not impossible, to generate IP traffic
   to explore multiple paths specifically

3.6.  Also Track Incoming Traffic for livenss check

   In addition to probing the outgoing paths, it is essential to monitor
   and account for the incoming traffic to ensure comprehensive network
   visibility of IPsec.  Incoming SA traffic counters are unique to
   IPsec compared to other tunneling or native IP connections.  In
   IPsec, the incoming counters reliably indicate a viable path.  This
   should be taken into account when probing IPsec paths.  For example,
   when the crypto subsystem is overloaded, the responder may miss out
   on Encrypted ESP Ping responses.  However, tracking the incoming
   traffic after the ping probe is sent would help applications to
   recognize the IPsec path is still viable.

4.  Protocol Specification

   In a typical use case, after completing an IPsec SA negotiation,
   [RFC7296], an IPsec peer wishing to verify the viability of the
   current network path for ESP packets MAY initiate an ESP Echo
   Request.  The ESP Echo Request packet must be encrypted.  If the SPIs
   are negotiated it SHOULD utilize an SPI value previously negotiated,
   e.g.  negotiated through IKEv2.

   The sender sets the ESP Next Header value to AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD which
   has the value 144, as specified in [RFC9347].  This can be followed
   by different echo request sub-type payloads with a well defined
   format and optional empty data blocks following it.

   The receiving IPsec peer, having established ESP through IKE, MAY
   respond to an ESP Echo Response.  When replying to an encrypted ESP
   Echo Request, the ESP Echo Response MUST be encrypted and utilize the
   corresponding SPI.  The receiver also sets the ESP Next Header value
   to AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD: 144, followed by the requested sub-type

   AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Payload starts from ESP Next Header value: 144 and
   followed one of the two Request payloads specified.

4.1.  Using Congestion Control Payload

   IP-TFS Congestion Control AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Payload Format as specified
   in [RFC9347] Section 6.1.2 can be used for Echo Request and response.
   When using this payload for Echo Request and response, IPv4 or IPv6
   Data Block MUST NOT be concatenated, especially when USE_AGGFRAG is
   not successfully negotiated.  This this request does not support
   requesting a specific return path.

   [AA when using USE_AGGFRAG tunnel is negotiated, responder may
   concatenate AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Congestion control probe]

   The Echo request and response payloads are not subject to IPsec
   Security Policy(SP), typically negotiated using IKEv2 a nd manually
   configured.  End padding padding would be necessary of the the tunnel
   is always sending fixed size ESP payload or possibly detect path
   anomalies.

   When probing do not take the lack of a response alone as an
   indication of the unreachability of the return path using ESP echo;
   also consider the received bytes on the return path.  IPsec has a
   unique advantage over other tunneling protocols when the return path
   shows incoming bytes, indicating that the path is partially
   functional.  This is especially useful when used as a liveness check
   on busy paths.  When there is no response, instead of concluding that
   the path is not viable and taking action, such as tearing down the
   IPsec connection, read the incoming bytes.  This would help avoid
   tearing down busy paths due to the missing ESP echo response.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are similar to other unconnected request-
   reply protocols such as ICMP or ICMPv6 echo.  The proposed ESP echo
   and response does not constitute an amplification attack because the
   ESP Echo Reply is almost same size as the ESP Echo Request.  Further
   this can be rate limited or filtered using ingress filtering per BCP
   38 [RFC2827]

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates [RFC9347] to allow ESP Echo Request and ESP
   Echo Response without a successful negotiation of USE_AGGFRAG.

   This document defines two new registrations for the IANA ESP
   [AGGFRAG] PAYLOAD Sub-Types.

         Value   ESP AGGFRAG_PAYLOAD Sub-Type       Reference
         -----   ------------------------------    ---------------
         3       ESP-ECHO-REQUEST                  [this document]
         4       ESP-ECHO-RESPONSE                 [this document]

                                  Figure 2

7.  Operational Considerations

   When an explicit return path is requested and the ESP Echo responder
   SHOULD make best effort to respond via this path, however, if local
   policies do not allow this respond via another SA.

   A typical implementation would be a ESP Echo socket.  And the socket
   would allow to set outgoing SPI at creation, optionally matching
   source and destination address.  Once this set before sending any
   data.  Userspcace can only write payload
